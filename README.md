## About This Project

This project is a faithful VHDL implementation of the Thomson MO5 computer for FPGA platforms, specifically designed for the DE1 development board featuring an Intel/Altera FPGA. It recreates the original MO5 architecture with enhancements such as VGA output, PS/2 keyboard support, and SD card storage.

## Special Thanks and Acknowledgements

### John Kent
Special thanks to John Kent for his invaluable advice and for developing the **CPU09** core, a 6809 CPU implementation that serves as the heart of this MO5 reproduction. His expertise in processor design and willingness to share knowledge have been instrumental in making this project possible.

The CPU09 core is used under its original license. Please refer to John's documentation for specific license details.

### Daniel Coulom
Heartfelt gratitude to Daniel Coulom for his extensive help, information, and resources related to the Thomson MO5. His dedication to preserving Thomson computer heritage through the [dcmoto.free.fr](http://dcmoto.free.fr) website has been an indispensable reference during this project's development.

Special thanks for his work on the SD drive implementation that has been adapted for this project. The original SD drive implementation is used according to its license as specified on dcmoto.free.fr.

## Additional Credits

- Thanks to the FPGA and retro-computing communities for their ongoing support and shared knowledge
- Appreciation to Thomson for creating the original MO5, a pioneering computer in French computing history
- Recognition to all contributors of open-source tools that made this implementation possible
